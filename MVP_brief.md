Overview
Trena AI is an AI-powered SaaS platform designed to help frontline salespeople (SDRs, BDMs,
AEs, founders) generate more leads, personalise outreach, and close deals faster. It removes the
manual work of researching prospects, crafting strategies, and finding the right contacts by offering
instant, tailored sales kits.

This document outlines the scope for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), our target user, feature
priorities, and a suggested prototype build path.


Target Users
**Primary Users:**
- Frontline salespeople (individual contributors)
- Founders who sell
- Sales reps without access to big CRMs or enablement teams

**Secondary Beneficiaries:**
- Sales leaders who will gain insight into what strategies convert through reporting (phase 2)

Key Problems We Solve
- Reps waste hours researching leads and writing outreach

- Outreach is often templated and lacks personalisation
- Reps dont have access to scalable tools for prospecting

MVP Goals
**Phase 1 = Tactical Utility**
Give reps the tools to:
- Prioritise who to contact based on real-world buying signals
- Research accounts instantly
- Generate personalised outreach (emails, scripts, LinkedIn messages)
- Move faster and with more confidence

**Phase 2 = Strategic Enablement**
- Help reps close deals faster
- Suggest upsell opportunities
- Provide sales leaders with strategic analytics

Sample User Journey: Week 1 Onboarding
**User: Jess, BDM at a software company with 100 target accounts**

To train the AI assistant around the user, not just sign them up.
The onboarding captures data that drives personalization:

Rep’s goals and quotas

Their motivators and selling style

Their industry and target market

Connection to their tools (CRM, email, calendar)

Optional: early lead preferences (industries, company sizes, etc.)

After onboarding, the user lands on a “Your First 3 Leads” experience where Trena generates 3 enriched leads and first outreach drafts.
