# PRD #0006: Dashboard - Daily Priorities View

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the main Dashboard (Home page) that serves as the rep's daily command center. It displays Today's Focus leads, pipeline stats, progress toward weekly activity goals, recent activity, quick action buttons, and motivational messaging - all optimized for mobile-first, single-tap interactions.

**Problem it solves:** Sales reps need a clear, actionable view of what to do today without digging through menus or lists. They need to see progress, stay motivated, and access key actions quickly. A cluttered or confusing dashboard wastes time and reduces engagement with the platform.

**Goal:** Create a mobile-first dashboard that shows reps exactly what to focus on today, tracks their progress toward weekly goals, celebrates wins, and provides single-tap access to key actions - all in a clean, scannable interface that loads in under 2 seconds.

## 2. Goals

1. Display "Today's Focus" leads prominently with single-tap actions
2. Show pipeline stats (leads researched, contacted, responded) for today and this week
3. Visualize progress toward weekly activity goals with clear, motivating UI
4. Surface recent activity (last 5 actions) for quick context
5. Provide quick action buttons (Research Lead, View All Leads, Settings)
6. Greet user with personalized, contextual messages based on progress and time of day
7. Update dashboard in real-time as user completes actions
8. Show helpful empty state with step-by-step checklist for new users
9. Load dashboard in under 2 seconds on mobile

## 3. User Stories

**As a sales rep**, I want to:
- See my top priorities for today immediately when I open the app
- Know how many leads I've researched and contacted this week
- Feel motivated by seeing my progress and streaks
- Quickly research a new lead or view all my leads with one tap
- See recent activity so I remember where I left off
- Be greeted personally so the app feels like it knows me
- Complete my daily tasks without navigating through multiple screens

**As a product owner**, I want to:
- Drive daily engagement by showing clear, actionable priorities
- Motivate reps with progress tracking and celebration of wins
- Make the app feel personal and motivating, not generic
- Ensure the dashboard works perfectly on mobile (where reps spend most time)
- Track which widgets/actions drive the most engagement

    - Contact 5 leads per week

26. For each goal, the system must display:
    - **Circular progress ring** (e.g., "7/10 researched") OR
    - **Horizontal progress bar** with percentage

    - Circular rings for primary goals (researched, contacted)
    - Horizontal bars for secondary goals (outreach generated)
28. The system must color-code progress:
    - On track (‚â•70%): Green
    - At risk (40-69%): Yellow
    - Behind (<40%): Red

    - Added to focus (‚≠ê)

### Quick Action Buttons (FR-ACTIONS)

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

### Color Scheme for Progress
- **On Track** (‚â•70%): Green (#22C55E)
- **At Risk** (40-69%): Yellow/Amber (#F59E0B)
- **Behind** (<40%): Red (#EF4444)
- **Completed** (100%): Green with checkmark (‚úÖ)

### Mobile Optimizations
- Stack stat cards horizontally (swipeable carousel)
- Use circular progress rings (more compact than bars on mobile)
- Make Today's Focus leads swipeable cards
- Sticky header with collapsible greeting on scroll
- Large touch targets (min 48x48px)
- Bottom action bar for primary CTAs

### UX Flow
1. User logs in ‚Üí Dashboard loads (SSR)
2. Greeting + Today's Focus appear instantly
3. Stats and progress lazy load (perceived speed)
4. User taps "Generate Outreach" on focus lead
5. Modal opens (PRD #0005)
6. User generates, copies outreach
7. User marks lead as contacted (checkbox)
8. Dashboard updates in real-time (removes from focus, increments "Contacted" stat)
9. Motivational message updates: "üí™ 1 more contact to hit your weekly goal!"

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Data Fetching Strategy
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fetch critical data (Today's Focus, stats) on server, render HTML
- **Client-Side Hydration**: Make interactive on client load
- **Lazy Loading**: Fetch recent activity and lower sections after initial render
- **SWR/React Query**: Cache dashboard data, revalidate on focus/user action

### Real-Time Updates Implementation
```javascript
// Optimistic update example
function markAsContacted(leadId) {
  // 1. Update UI immediately
  updateLocalState(leadId, { contacted: true });
  removeFr omFocusList(leadId);
  incrementStat('contacted');

  // 2. Sync with backend
  api.markContacted(leadId)
    .catch(err => {
      // 3. Revert on failure
      revertLocalState(leadId);
      showToast('Failed to mark as contacted');
    });
}
```

### Weekly Goals Calculation
```sql
-- Calculate weekly goals progress
SELECT
  goal_type,
  goal_target,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= date_trunc('week', NOW())) as current_count
FROM lead_actions
WHERE user_id = $1 AND action_type IN ('researched', 'contacted', 'generated_outreach')
GROUP BY goal_type;
```

### Streak Calculation
```javascript
// Calculate daily activity streak
function calculateStreak(userId) {
  // Fetch all activity dates for user
  const activityDates = getActivityDates(userId);

  let streak = 0;
  let currentDate = today();

  while (activityDates.includes(currentDate)) {
    streak++;
    currentDate = previousDay(currentDate);
  }

  return streak;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexes**:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_lead_actions_user_date ON lead_actions(user_id, created_at DESC);
  CREATE INDEX idx_researched_leads_user_date ON researched_leads(user_id, researched_at DESC);
  ```
- **Query Caching**: Use Redis to cache dashboard queries for 5 minutes
- **Pagination**: Limit recent activity to 5 items (no need to fetch all history)
- **Prefetching**: Prefetch Today's Focus on app launch (service worker)

### Database Schema Updates

**user_activity_goals:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_activity_goals (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id) NOT NULL,
  goal_type TEXT CHECK (goal_type IN ('research', 'contact', 'outreach')),

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Goal Customization**: Should users be able to set custom weekly goals (e.g., "I want to contact 20/week"), or use defaults?
2. **Time Period Toggle**: Should we add a toggle to switch between "Today" and "This Week" views for stats?
3. **Notifications**: Should we send push notifications when user hasn't checked dashboard by noon?
4. **Widgets Priority**: If screen is small, should we prioritize Today's Focus over stats (hide stats below fold)?
5. **Streak Recovery**: If user breaks a streak, should we show "Your 7-day streak ended - start a new one!" or hide it?
6. **Activity Detail**: Should recent activity items be clickable to view full lead details?
7. **Motivational Copy**: Should motivational messages be more playful/fun vs professional/serious?
8. **Refresh Indicator**: Should we show a visual indicator when dashboard auto-updates (subtle badge or animation)?

## Next Steps After Implementation

Once dashboard is complete:
1. Dashboard becomes the central hub for all Trena workflows
2. Gamification data (PRD #0007) will surface on dashboard (badges, achievements)
3. Post-MVP: Add analytics widgets (conversion rates, response rates)
4. Post-MVP: Team leaderboards for competitive reps
5. Post-MVP: Smart recommendations ("Leads similar to your recent wins")
