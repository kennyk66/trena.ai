### Technical Highlights

**Priority Scoring Algorithm:**
- Buying signals: 0-10 points (funding +2, leadership +2, growth +1, news +1, tech +1)
- Fit score: 0-4 points (industry match +2, title match +2)
- Total: 0-14 points
- Priority levels: high (6+), medium (3-5), low (0-2)
- Special rule: 2+ signals with any fit = high priority

**Focus Generation Algorithm:**
1. Fetch high-priority leads
2. Exclude leads contacted in last 7 days
3. Exclude yesterday's focus leads
4. Sort by priority score (desc)
5. Apply diversity logic (different companies/industries)
6. Take top 5
7. If <5 high-priority, fill with medium-priority

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Database indexes for fast priority queries
- Efficient focus generation with smart exclusions
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

**Build Metrics:**
- Routes: 29 total (26 existing + 3 APIs + 1 page)
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- ESLint: 0 warnings
- Bundle sizes: Optimized (focus page 4.86 kB)
