# PRD #0002: Onboarding & Profile Learning

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This PRD defines the comprehensive 7-step onboarding flow for Trena.ai that captures the sales rep's goals, motivators, communication style, target buyers, and provides a "Quick Win" with 3 enriched leads using Lusha API integration.

**Problem it solves:** Sales reps need a personalized experience from day one. Generic tools don't understand their goals, quotas, selling style, or target market. This onboarding captures critical context that enables Trena to deliver hyper-personalized buyer research, outreach, and prioritization.

**Goal:** Create a conversational, mobile-first onboarding experience that collects essential rep data and delivers immediate value through a "Quick Win" of 3 enriched leads.

## 2. Goals

1. Capture comprehensive user profile data (goals, quotas, motivators, style, target buyers)
2. Create a smooth, conversational onboarding experience that feels natural and quick
3. Demonstrate immediate value by generating 3 real enriched leads via Lusha API
4. Store all profile data securely in Supabase for use across all Trena features
5. Ensure onboarding is fully responsive and mobile-friendly
6. Set up foundation for future tool integrations (email, CRM, LinkedIn)
7. Complete onboarding in under 5 minutes

## 3. User Stories

**As a sales rep**, I want to:
- Tell Trena about my sales goals and quota so it understands what success means for me
- Share my motivators (promotion, bonus, proving myself) so Trena can align with my "need behind the need"
- Define my selling style so outreach feels authentic to my voice
- Specify my target buyer personas so Trena researches the right prospects
- See immediate value (3 enriched leads) so I trust the platform can help me
- Navigate back and forth through onboarding if I need to change answers
- Complete setup quickly on my phone since I'm always on the go

**As a product owner**, I want to:
- Collect structured data that powers personalization across all features
- Demonstrate ROI immediately with real Lusha data
- Track onboarding completion rates and drop-off points
- Ensure data quality by making all steps required

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

The following are explicitly **not** included in this PRD:

- Actual OAuth integration flows for email/CRM/LinkedIn (placeholder UI only)
- Email verification during onboarding
- Ability to skip onboarding entirely
- Admin/manager onboarding flows (sales rep only)
- Video tutorials or guided tours within onboarding
- A/B testing different onboarding flows
- Multi-language support
- Importing contacts during onboarding
- Team/organization setup
- Payment/billing information collection

## 6. Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- Use Trena.ai brand colors and typography (from PRD #0001)
- Clean, minimal design with generous white space
- Large, readable fonts optimized for mobile
- Progress bar at top of each step
- Consistent "Back" and "Next" button placement

### Conversational Copy Examples
- **Welcome**: "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Let's get Trena set up to be your ultimate sales sidekick."
- **Personal**: "First things firstâ€”tell us about your role and goals."
- **Motivators**: "What gets you fired up? What are you working toward?"
- **Target Buyer**: "Who are you trying to reach? The more specific, the better."
- **Summary**: "Here's what we learned about you. Look good?"
- **Quick Win**: "ðŸŽ‰ Check out these 3 hot leads we found just for you!"

### Flow Diagram
```
Signup â†’ Welcome â†’ Personal & Role â†’ Motivators & Style â†’
Target Buyer â†’ Connect Tools (placeholder) â†’ Summary â†’
Quick Win (Lusha) â†’ Dashboard
```

### Mobile-First Considerations
- Single-column layout
- One question per screen on mobile when possible
- Auto-focus on first input field
- Use native mobile inputs (dropdowns, multi-select)
- Minimize typing with smart defaults and selections

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Lusha API Integration
- **Endpoint**: Use Lusha People Search API
- **Authentication**: API key stored in environment variable `LUSHA_API_KEY`
- **Rate Limits**: Be aware of Lusha rate limits (cache results if needed)
- **Search Parameters**: Map user profile data to Lusha filters:
  - Industry â†’ `company.industry`
  - Job titles â†’ `person.jobTitle`
  - Region â†’ `person.location.country` or `person.location.region`
- **Error Handling**:
  - If API fails, show friendly message: "We're having trouble fetching leads right now. You can explore your dashboard and we'll have leads ready soon!"
  - Log errors for debugging
  - Consider showing mock data as fallback

### Data Storage
- Store all user profile data in Supabase `user_profiles` table
- Use JSONB for arrays (motivators, industries, roles) for flexibility
- Encrypt sensitive data if API credentials are stored (future)

### State Management
- Use React state or form library (React Hook Form, Formik) to manage onboarding state
- Persist progress to database after each step completion
- Allow users to resume onboarding if they close browser mid-flow

### Performance
- Lazy load Lusha API call only on Step 7
- Optimize form validation for instant feedback
- Preload next step while user is on current step

### Functions to Implement
From @onboarding.md reference:
- `init_user_profile()` - Initialize user profile on signup
- `save_onboarding_step(step_number, step_data)` - Save progress after each step
- `connect_provider(provider_type)` - Placeholder for future integrations
- `generate_first_leads(user_profile)` - Call Lusha API and return 3 leads

## 8. Success Metrics

**Functional Success:**
1. âœ… User completes all 7 onboarding steps
2. âœ… User sees 3 enriched leads from Lusha
3. âœ… User profile data is correctly saved to database
4. âœ… User can navigate back/forward between steps
5. âœ… Onboarding is marked complete and user lands on dashboard

**Business Success:**
- 90%+ onboarding completion rate (users who start Step 1 reach Step 7)
- Average completion time < 5 minutes
- User perceives value from Quick Win leads (measured via future surveys)

**Technical Success:**
- Lusha API calls succeed with <2s response time
- Zero data loss (all user inputs saved correctly)
- Mobile responsive (works on iOS/Android browsers)
- No console errors during onboarding flow

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Lusha API Limits**: What's our Lusha plan and monthly credit limit? Should we cap Quick Win to 3 leads to manage costs?
2. **Data Privacy**: Do we need explicit consent checkboxes for storing user data (GDPR compliance)?
3. **Onboarding Re-access**: Can users re-take onboarding later to update their profile, or is it one-time only?
4. **Lead Quality**: If Lusha returns low-quality leads (no emails), should we fetch more until we have 3 good ones?
5. **Progress Persistence**: If user closes browser mid-onboarding, should we auto-resume or ask if they want to continue?
6. **Analytics**: Which analytics events should we track? (step_completed, step_abandoned, onboarding_completed, etc.)
7. **Quota Format**: Should we parse quota input to extract amount and time period, or keep as free text?
8. **Integration Placeholders**: Should we collect "coming soon" email signups for integrations, or just show static UI?

## Next Steps After Implementation

Once onboarding is complete:
1. Users will have rich profiles that power all future features
2. Implement PRD #0003: Buyer Research Agent (will use target buyer data)
3. Implement PRD #0004: Lead Prioritization (will use motivators and sales motion)
4. Implement PRD #0005: Outreach Generation (will use selling style and motivators)
5. Eventually replace placeholder integrations with real OAuth flows
