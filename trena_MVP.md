# **Trena.ai -- Product Principles & MVP Brief**

## **The Salesperson's Journey**

A frontline salesperson lives under constant pressure:

-   **Targets & KPIs** drive their day. Quota, pipeline, deals closed.

-   But behind those KPIs sits the *need behind the need*: paying rent,
    > getting promoted, hitting bonus, proving themselves, building a
    > career.

Their daily reality:

1.  **Research** -- Scrambling to understand prospects, often messy and
    > incomplete.

2.  **Outreach** -- Writing generic emails or LinkedIn messages that
    > usually get ignored.

3.  **Calls/Meetings** -- Turning up without truly knowing the buyer's
    > drivers.

4.  **Pipeline Management** -- Constantly asking "who's worth my time?"

5.  **Closing Deals** -- Success depends on trust, personalisation, and
    > timing.

If they fail → the company misses revenue.

If they succeed → the buyer feels understood, the company grows, and the
salesperson hits their goals.

## **Why Trena Matters**

Trena sits in the middle of this journey as the **extension of the
rep**.

-   Makes research automatic.

-   Generates outreach that feels personal and human.

-   Prioritises where to spend time based on signals.

-   Closes the gap between buyer and seller by surfacing the buyer's
    > *need behind the need*.

Trena doesn't just help a rep hit quota. It helps the **company grow**
and helps the **buyer feel understood**.

## **Product Principles**

-   **Delight the customer first\
    > **

    -   Sales rep: tool is an extension of them.

    -   Sales leader/company: delivers revenue impact, more pipeline,
        > deals, logos.

    -   Buyer: closes the gap between buyer and seller by surfacing
        > their real needs.

-   **Needs analysis everywhere\
    > \
    > ** Always go deeper than surface KPIs.

-   **Hyper-personalisation\
    > \
    > ** No generic outreach. Every output must feel handcrafted.

-   **Relentless simplicity\
    > \
    > ** UI/UX must be dead simple. From day one, anyone should know
    > what to do.

-   **Voice-first\
    > \
    > ** Talk to the rep in their tone and style.

-   **Mobile optimised\
    > \
    > ** Reps live on their phone. MVP must be mobile-friendly.

-   **Cost discipline\
    > \
    > ** Be ruthless with spend. Always question: build vs. buy.

## **MVP Must-Haves**

1.  **Onboarding & profile learning\
    > **

    -   Capture rep's goals, quotas, motivators, and style.

2.  **Buyer research agent\
    > **

    -   Pull company + individual signals.

    -   Build a quick persona dynamically.

3.  **Outreach generation agent\
    > **

    -   Personalised email, LinkedIn, call script in rep's voice.

4.  **Lead prioritisation\
    > **

    -   Highlight where to focus based on intent signals.

5.  **Simple dashboard\
    > **

    -   Today's priorities, pipeline progress, single-tap actions.

6.  **Light gamification\
    > **

    -   Small wins, streaks, badges. Enough to form habit.

7.  **Cost-efficient infra\
    > **

    -   Use APIs where smart, but plan for in-house where strategic.

8.  **Mobile web first\
    > **

    -   Fast, friendly, usable on the go.

## **Future State (Post-MVP)**

-   Coaching layer: explain *why* these signals matter and how to angle
    > conversations.

-   Buyer-seller alignment: show reps where their approach and buyer
    > needs diverge.

-   Deeper gamification: team leaderboards, competitions, nudges.

-   Sales leader dashboards: analytics on usage and pipeline impact.

-   Offline/voice input: dictate notes or outreach on the move.

## **Extra Recommendations**

-   Keep the core loop tight: company in → insights → outreach → action.

-   Build habit: must feel natural to check daily.

-   Data freshness is key: reps must trust insights.

-   Outreach must feel human, never "AI-written."

-   Architect for extensibility so new agents slot in without
    > re-platforming.?
