# Session Summary - 2025-10-09

## Overview
Successfully completed **PRD #0002 - Onboarding & Profile Learning** with full implementation of the 7-step onboarding flow, Lusha API integration, and all supporting infrastructure.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. TypeScript & Code Quality Fixes ✅
- Fixed all `any` type errors in `lib/lusha/client.ts`
- Added proper type interfaces: `LushaFilters`, `LushaRawPerson`, `LushaRawResponse`
- Resolved all ESLint warnings across the codebase
- Clean production build with zero errors

### 2. Backend Infrastructure ✅

**API Routes Created (4)**
```
POST   /api/onboarding/save      - Save onboarding step data
POST   /api/onboarding/complete  - Mark onboarding complete
GET    /api/onboarding/data      - Retrieve user onboarding data
POST   /api/leads/generate       - Generate leads via Lusha API
```

**Services & Utilities**
- `lib/onboarding/onboarding-service.ts` - Server-side business logic
- `lib/onboarding/onboarding-client.ts` - Client-side API wrappers
- `lib/lusha/client.ts` - Lusha API integration with TypeScript
- `lib/hooks/use-onboarding.ts` - React hook for onboarding navigation

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Email/CRM/LinkedIn integrations are placeholders ("Coming Soon")
2. Lusha API may require valid key for real lead data
3. No automated tests yet
4. Form data not persisted in local storage (session only)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Implement actual email integration (Gmail OAuth)
2. Implement CRM integration (Salesforce/HubSpot)
3. Add unit tests for all components and services
4. Add E2E tests for onboarding flow
5. Implement form auto-save with local storage
6. Add analytics tracking for onboarding completion
7. Implement onboarding completion gate on dashboard
